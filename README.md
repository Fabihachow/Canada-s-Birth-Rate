# Canada-s-Birth-Rate
Birthrate Analysis Project
Overview
This project aims to analyze factors influencing birthrates using machine learning models, including Random Forest and Linear Regression.

Data from:
Source: (https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/91f0015m/91f0015m2024001-eng.htm#a5)

Content: Includes year, average age, proportion percentages, parental roles, and province-specific data.

My Objectives:
Identify key factors affecting birthrates.

Build robust models to predict future birthrates.

Evaluate model performance using cross-validation and test sets.

Models Used:
Linear Regression: Basic model to establish a baseline.

Random Forest: Advanced model for better accuracy and handling non-linear relationships.

Thank you very much!
